# LM3409 Calculator
A calculator for them LM3409 chip supporting circuit values

## What is it?

Many integrated circuits are designed to support multiple configurations. These configurations are set extenally with other circuit elements including: resistors, and capacitors. In addition, ICs often require other components to work correctly like inductors, MOSFETs etc.

The LM3409 chip is an LED driving IC designed to push a constant current to a LED module. In order to establish the correct voltage and correct current, the external components must be set to very specific values. This calculator runs the mathematics for the LM3409 in order to select the appropriate values for external components.
